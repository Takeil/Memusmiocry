The love that we had never existed
Loved you in a mind that was twisted
Like music, it drifted
My sorrows, lifted
The pain was tilted
Shots were missed and
Still, I persisted

You don’t know me, and I don’t know you
Yet your melodies made me anew
I thought it could just be us two
Never mind the fact that you
Were never really true

Like the music I love, everything about
The harmony, the rhythm, the lyrics in and out
The way it sounds, and how it removes my doubts
Of the truth that I was afraid to let out

Loving you is loving music
Always knew the right lyric
Even fast, failed to make me panic
Felt good just by being dynamic

Yet, you’re not mine
You were never mine

I can’t make you
I can’t have you
All I know is that you
Always made me feel knew
